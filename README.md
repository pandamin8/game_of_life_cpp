# game_of_life_cpp
My implementation of Conway's game of life with ```c++``` and ```SDL2```.

The code is not perfect so feel free to hunt for problems.

You need to install [SDL2](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/Installation) to be able to compile the code.

For Debian/Ubuntu
``` bash
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-2.0-0
```

Compile with
``` bash
g++ -o game_of_life main.cpp -lSDL2
```
